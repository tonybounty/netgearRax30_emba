<pre>This utility allows re-naming several volumes in one go atomically.</pre>
<pre>For example, if you have volumes A and B, then you may rename A into B</pre>
<pre>and B into A at one go, and the operation will be atomic. This allows</pre>
<pre>implementing atomic UBI volumes upgrades. E.g., if you have volume A</pre>
<pre>and want to upgrade it atomically, you create a temporary volume B,</pre>
<pre>put your new data to B, then rename A to B and B to A, and then you</pre>
<pre>may remove old volume B.</pre>
<pre>It is also allowed to re-name multiple volumes at a time, but 16 max.</pre>
<pre>renames at once, which means you may specify up to 32 volume names.</pre>
<pre>If you have volumes A and B, and re-name A to B, but do not re-name</pre>
<pre>B to something else in the same request, old volume B will be removed</pre>
<pre>and A will be renamed into B.</pre>
